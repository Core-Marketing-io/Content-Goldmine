## 🛠️ Debugging Checklist
If your content feels flat, ask:  

- [ ] Did I define the ROLE clearly?  
- [ ] Did I include real CONTEXT (question/objection)?  
- [ ] Did I specify the TASK?  
- [ ] Did I ask for a FORMAT?  
- [ ] Did I limit or guide the length/tone?  

👉 Vague input = vague output. Specific input = persuasive content.

## 🚀 Additional Training: AEO Power Moves
Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the future.  
Here’s how to make sure your content gets **found and quoted by AI assistants**:  

### 1. Write in Q&A Format
- Use customer questions as **headlines** (“How much does it cost?”).  
- Answer directly in the first 1–2 sentences.  

### 2. Be Conversational
- Write like you’re talking to a real customer, not writing a textbook.  

### 3. Make Every Answer Stand Alone
- Assume AI will lift your answer out of context.  
- Always restate the subject inside the answer.  

### 4. Use Variations
- Answer the same question with different phrasing:  
  - “How much does it cost?”  
  - “What’s the average price?”  
  - “How much should I budget?”  

### 5. Add Trust Signals
- Mention proof points (years in business, reviews, guarantees).  
- Sprinkle in local identifiers (city names, service areas).  

### 6. Publish Everywhere
- Website FAQ  
- Google Business posts  
- Short-form video scripts  
- Social media captions  

### 7. Show Expertise
- Include short lines that prove experience:  
  “After helping hundreds of customers, here’s what we’ve found…”
