## 🧩 New: Master Pre-Prompt System
Dropping short prompts alone won’t guarantee strong outputs.  
That’s why we’ve included a **Master Pre-Prompt System**: a reusable setup you paste once into your LLM.  

The pre-prompt sets:  
- **Role & Voice** → direct-response strategist, plainspoken tone, no fluff  
- **Business Profile** → your services, areas, proof, offer, and CTA  
- **Rules** → answer-first, persuasive, AEO-friendly writing  
- **Deliverables** → default outputs (Post, Reel Script, Google Post, FAQ Entry, Hooks)  
- **Refinement** → ensures clarity, proof, CTA, and specifics every time  

With this in place, your Basic and Advanced prompts generate **consistent, persuasive, AI-optimized content**.

## 💡 Who is this for?
- Local service businesses (self-storage, HVAC, med spas, contractors, auto shops, and more)  
- Small/medium-sized teams creating their own content  
- Owners who want to generate **real content that drives sales**, not fluffy posts full of emojis
