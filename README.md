## 🚀 What is Content Goldmine?
Content Goldmine is a **plug-and-play prompt library** for small and medium-sized business owners.  
Instead of wasting time guessing what to post, this resource gives you **fill-in-the-blank prompts** that generate:  
- Blog posts  
- Emails  
- Social media content  
- FAQ answers  
- Short-form video scripts  

And because it’s built around **questions customers are already asking**, everything you publish is designed to help you **rank in Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** — the future of being found by AI and search engines.
